I think one of my positive traits is the fact that I can listen well to people. I can usually listen to someone for long periods of time even if it’s boring or not. This is good since if someone needs to vent out their feelings, I can listen to them. Although, I don’t usually have good responses. I was never the kind of person to go to for asking about life choices. I was usually the one to ask the questions. I like to think that I’m hardworking. I usually try my best to reach a goal, although now I’ve changed the way I'm motivated to study. I’ve stopped relying on motivation (it’s volatile) to study. Now it’s just a habit to study for long periods of time. If something is hard, I use drive to push myself forward; not motivation. The same thing with goals. I don’t like to use goals because if you set a goal, you aren’t paying attention to how to actually reach that goal. This is why you should rely on the system to reach your goals. (based off of James Scholz and Atomic Habits [book]). I try to be helpful most of the time even if it’s something I barely know anything about. I’d like to think I’m loyal as well. Usually if I befriend someone, I have a large amount of trust for them. Whereas everyone else, I don’t usually have trust in them. That’s one downside of me. You really need to build up a lot of trust to know me fully. Even if you’re my friend, I still don’t have a lot of trust in you. Recently, I’ve actually been thinking about my life choices and what I should aim for during HS and University. I know realize that I really aim for harder goals.
