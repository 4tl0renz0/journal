honestly right now, i'm just feeling very tired. physically and emotionally the more day that pass, the more i worry about my future generally. i really need to fix my schedule, if i keep this up, i'm never gonna get any work done.i'm starting to realize slowly but surely that i'm never gonna get close to a relationship anytime soon if i'm being honest...
